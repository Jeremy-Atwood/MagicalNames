### Todos

 - Create the function to add the Wizard/ Witch name combinging the inputed name and color
 - Make it so you choose the color from an array
 - Create a better front-end so it is not the localhost:8080 & localhost:8080/colorAndNames
 - Add function to simply enter the name and color and not have to use the CRUD methods
 - Successfully connect the seeded data in the data.sql file to auto-generate initial DB
 - Successfully connect the routes to the MySQL database that I have created in MySQL Workbench
